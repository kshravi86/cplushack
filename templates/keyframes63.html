	</p>




	
	When a bean is only used as a property of another bean it can be declared as an inner bean. Springâ€™s XML-based configuration metadata provides the use of bean element inside the property or constructor-arg elements of a bean definition, in order to define the so-called inner bean. Inner beans are always anonymous and they are always scoped as prototypes.
